# Module 3 Challenge: Election_Analysis

**Overview of Election Audit**

A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, asked for help to complete the election audit of a recent Congressional election. The purpose of this election audit analysis is to find important result information (listed below):

**Election-Audit Summary:**
 This script can be used—with some modifications—for any election by adding in more headers, so the txt.file is easier to read. For example I've added in the "Candidates:" header so that it wouln't be a mystery section of information. 

Here's the "Candidates:" edit I made within the code:

Here's the "Candidates:" txt.file output:

 I noticed the f-strings were hard to read as a whole from one glance, so another suggestion would be to condense some of the loops and print all of the information at the end of the script (but still being sent to the txt.file) so that it's not split up within each loop.
